    \brief A default context implementation for use with \l WebView.

    This default WebContext implementation has the default user agent string
    used by the Morph browser as well as the UA override mechanism that allows
    sending an overridden user agent for given domains/websites, based on the
    form factor.

    It has its data path (for cache and cookie database) set to the standard
    writable data location for the current application, which is based on the
    application name (see \c Qt.application.name), for example
    \e ~/.local/share/myApp/.

    Note that the \l WebView component already uses this default context, so
    there is no need to explicitly instantiate a \c WebContext unless you
    want to override some of its default properties.

// needing the full set of properties and methods exposed by QtWebEngine.
